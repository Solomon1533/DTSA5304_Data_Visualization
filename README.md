Project Title: Global YouTube Statistics 2023
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-youtube-statistics-2023
for this project I have used the modified dataset. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Solomon1533/Test1/main/Test1.csv
The modified data set covers only the developed countries instead of the global data. 

Introduction:

1. Interesting Data on YouTube Channels

I've been exploring a dataset on Kaggle called "Global YouTube Statistics 2023" 
Global YouTube Statistics 2023 (kaggle.com)
This dataset provides insights into the most subscribed YouTube channels. Since the full dataset covered a wide range of countries, I narrowed my focus to include channels from developed economies like Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, UK, and USA.

2. Analyzing Connections

Within this specific dataset, several attributes caught my attention. These include:

Demographics: Population and unemployment rate

Content: Video categories and viewership

Channel Performance: Number of subscribers and content categories

By analyzing the relationships between these data points, I hope to uncover interesting trends and answer questions. 

Through this analysis, I aim to identify correlations between various factors. This could help explain, for example, why the categories are related to the unemployment rate etc...


Objectives:

Data search and Preprocessing:

Collect and preprocess the provided dataset, ensuring data quality and consistency. Data cleaned. Handle missing data and format inconsistencies. Prepare the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

I have conducted EDA to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
Explore data distribution, mean avarage of different dataset, and variations.
Visualize relationships and correlations between variables.

Feature Engineering:

Create new features, particularly calculating the distance between the restaurant and the delivery location based on geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Encode categorical variables like 'Type_of_order' and 'Type_of_vehicle' for modeling.
